<h3><em><u>Introduction:</u></em></h3>
<p>Lets get right into it, in 20 years old and Ive always had a special interest towards technology, travel and automobiles but like most Indian students I couldnot afford to get my hands on everything
I want to experience and thats where this blog comes into place I shall eventually make Youtube Reviews too but that might take some time as Im a beginner.
Ive always been an Android Head and am very keen on rooting my phone and flashing a custom roms is my favourite pass time.
The first every Phone which was bought for me was when I was in grade IX, it was a HTC Desire U that consisted of a 1.2Ghz dual core processor along with 512mb of ram.
<strong>(FunFact:Modernday TV have much more ram then to first phone.)</strong> By the time I reached class X, I managed to break my phone and then later that year I sucessfully laid my hands on the then released flagship from Samsung The Galaxy Note 5, after which I got the Note8
fastforward to today and i used a Samsung Galaxy S10+. I've also owned a lot headphones and Earphones as I consider myself to be an Audiophile.</p>
<p>I also do love to travel and go on adventures, Ive been to many places in India but Goa's on my mindðŸ˜‡ and im also planning for Kasol but it might take a while.
Coming to GOA its the most freedom and magical place ive ever seen and the vibe there is something you witness and not express. Okay so time to hop onto the the Automotive part of the blog, I've always wanted to ride and review Automobiles of all sorts so why not right?
I know it sound very vague but youll see for yourself.</p>
